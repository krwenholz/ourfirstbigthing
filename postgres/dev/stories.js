          "It was a beautiful summer‚Äôs day, 70 degrees, with scattered clouds and the occasional cool breeze. It had been that way every moment, of every day, for the last 5 years, except for the pre-scheduled rain burst at exactly 12:01 to 1:35. People had, and continued to be, very particular about the weather. Some wanted downpours, others a gentle trickle. It couldn‚Äôt occur in the early hours, or too late in the evening. Every drop was meticulously orchestrated and accounted for.",
          "It had never rained in the morning, or on a weekday. Evenings were off-limits, of course, and the times that had been chosen were only agreed upon after an arduous and lengthy process of debate. Each neighborhood met on a bi-weekly basis to discuss the matter, always requiring a quorum, where all the minutiae of the day would be discussed and recorded in triplicate for the benefit of those later needing to review the proceedings.",
          "Mondays were already too difficult to even consider including spontaneous weather, and as Tuesdays followed Mondays, they were also a settled matter. Wednesdays were, and always had been, reserved for sport tournaments. Only once had it rained on a Wednesday, and that regrettable oversight led to a dozen ruined paint jobs, a hand full of arrests, and a panic stricken individual convinced they were drowning in the comfort of their porch rocking chair. Three emergency sessions later, and through countless mountains of paperwork, it seemed the matter had all but been resolved via democratic debate. So for the interim, Wednesday was strictly off limits for inclement weather.",
          "Thursday and Friday were no better, as those leaving work were finally free to take the weekend as they wished, so rain was not a welcome sight there either. Saturdays, as one could guess, were busy catching up on all things left to the last minute. Sadly, that left Sunday, and only for a single slot of time. Only then could everyone nuzzle up during the lull of the day, and stare out their windows as the perfectly tuned and precisely executed downpour pounded the city for the pre-agreed up time of exactly 1 hour 35 minutes. Not one minute more, or one drop less.",
          "And above all this, orchestrating this weather, was a man sitting in an orthopaedically approved chair, in an air-conditioned room high above the city. Basking in the gentle loving glow of fluorescent lighting, in the midst of all this malaise, at the heart of all this weather, was James Icarus Banks.",
          "Mr. Banks watched the weather every day from 9:06 to 4:53. He was a weatherman, and he oversaw the most complex meteorological system ever devised, on board one of the most technologically advanced machines ever conceived. It was known as the Leviathan. His ship was accompanied by two others, The Memento, and the Ark. They were its sisters, each equally impressive in their size and achievement. A single ship stretched the length of New York‚Äôs Manhattan, as if a great knife had descended down and slipped into the earth, cutting away a raw slice of flesh.",
          "And with that wound left behind, that raw flesh bled life, seeping out to pool into thousands of schools, parks, homes, skyscrapers and streets. In those small corners of the ship, people lived, laughed, started families, died, were born, played music, competed, lost, flipped burgers, mopped floors, wrote stories, and lived their lives with only the thin hull of the ship protecting them from the oblivion of nothingness that was the expanse of space.",
          "And Mr. Banks, who oversaw this triumphant testament of man‚Äôs ability to carve in the vast desert of space a single bastion of life, knew only two things would never change. The first, as he knew all too well, was the weather. The second was this; He was unbelievably, undeniably, unequivocally bored out of his mind.",
          "Something had to change."

          "Going to HR was not Mr. Bank's favorite past time. It was always very involved, very arduous, and worst of all, extremely accommodating. Of course, that wasn't entirely HR's fault. HR had long ago been completely automated. All its human inhabitants had been fired, layed off, or generally given reduced benefits to 'gradually downsize' the branch and be replaced with self-help kiosks. Almost immediately, office satisfaction went up by all possible means of measurement, and the program was deemed a smashing success in the quarterly employee survey also supplied by the new HR department.",
          "Still, Banks wished there were a more convenient way to deal with internal office politics and general job dissatisfaction, but this was the way things were, and there wasn't much Banks could do about it. Getting up, Banks headed to HR, turning 45 degrees in his chair, reaching his hand out, and opening the HR-Self-Help Kiosk tucked away in the corner of his office. Exhausted, annoyed, and perspiring, Banks stepped inside and closed the privacy door behind him, shielding himself from any discerning ears that might be listening to his private conversations.",
          "The kiosk was cozy, warm, and generally comfortable enough, with a large screen expanding in the middle of the enclosure. Peering at it, Banks began to fill the prerequisite questions that every HR visit mandated."

Shifting an hour back would have caused massive interruption to meteorological instruments, which were only ever designed for a unidirectional time flow in the intra-ship time schedule.

Local mayors and leaders were concerned shifting forward would inevitably cause a mass mishap in late appointments, un-bused school children in the wee hours of the morning, and congressional sessions that would interweave into pre-planned holidays. It was considered far too risky, and far too difficult. And so it was left unfinished.",

Of course, that was unlikely. The investors of the Leviathan had spared no expense in its creation, save for Technical and Administrative personnel, many of whom refused to work on Sundays. They were a bit understaffed.",

He had to make the most of this time, savor every moment, or better yet, stop it from ending. Furiously typing, fingers flying on the keyboard, he entered out a single command, then hit enter. Waiting, holding his breath, the clock halted at 1:35, unchanging. Every synchronized clock on the ship was stuck at 1:35pm, on a Sunday afternoon. Outside, the rain continued pouring.",

Basking in the gentle glow the screens, each monitor was a window into the different lives of the neighborhoods on the ship. Those neighborhoods, from the look of it, were quickly descending into chaos.",

The storm systems were independently scheduled, using their own internal clocks for redundancy. It's system, and the meteorological systems, were now completely out of sync.",
        "On another screen, small shapes, which Banks could only assume to be children, were jumping in the small lakes left by the downpour. Around them, a sea of cars were beginning to form, their owners long having abandoned them due to a lack of visibility. It had been years since any cars were built with windshield wipers, as it neither rain, nor snowed. At Least, not without a schedule.",
        "A smile slowly began to creep up the sides of Banks mouth, as he eyes darted from one monitor to another. A man was shaking his fist at a cloud, using a waste bin as a makeshift umbrella. A woman was covering her dogs mouth, fearing it might drown, as the creature stared into the downpour, utterly and completely dumbfounded.",
        "And while the mayhem roared down on the city, banks began to lean back in his chair, and grinned a large toothy grin. People panicking, children playing, no one would be sure when, or whether, the weather would end; And that was exactly as Banks intended it."

Sakurai rises painfully to the surface and sees Melanie and Gamon flailing with staff-less hands while Bard holds onto a plank of wood. "Mai!" Bard yells, but she is nowhere to be seen. "There!" he yells before diving under the water. Sakurai follows him to find Mai desperately trying to remove her heavy plate armor while being dragged along the bottom river bed. With their knives, Sakurai and Bard sever the leather straps of her suit until she is light enough to bring upwards. All three reach air as soon as the river deposits them all into the ocean. A moment slower and Mai would have sunk along with her steel into the endless watery abyss.',

GET AWAY NOW!!!\" Sakurai screams out, there is no time for anyone to look around, there is no time to pray, there is only time to dig and claw at the ocean with everything he has. The world goes black from the deafening impact of a mountain of flesh slapping the water's surface. The waves send the party rolling through the waters, up or down are lost to them until they gain the courage to open their eyes and look for light. From the surface Sakurai sees something rising from the water yet again, only far larger than anything he could have dreamed of. At first it seems a mountainous torso of some creature, this thought dies when it splits open to reveal a tunnel of teeth. The great maw is sucking in the ocean and Sakurai's party in with it as it eclipses the sun, replacing it with its own thousand burning eyes. ",

Angry and starved from lonely decades the Mimic‚Äôs desiccated limbs ooze out of it and it digs long claws into the ground to drag itself toward the delicious looking child. Over its teeth comes a great tongue longer than Mai is tall, darting out rapidly, desperate to grab anything it can eat.

I‚Äôve been hoarding, waiting until the prices were right.
