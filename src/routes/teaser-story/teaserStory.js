        "It was a beautiful summer’s day, 70 degrees, with scattered clouds and the occasional cool breeze. It had been that way every moment, of every day, for the last 5 years, except for the pre-scheduled rain burst at exactly 12:01 to 1:35. People had, and continued to be, very particular about the weather. Some wanted downpours, others a gentle trickle. It couldn’t occur in the early hours, or too late in the evening. Every drop was meticulously orchestrated and accounted for.",
        "It had never rained in the morning, or on a weekday. Evenings were off-limits, of course, and the times that had been chosen were only agreed upon after an arduous and lengthy process of debate. Each neighborhood met on a bi-weekly basis to discuss the matter, always requiring a quorum, where all the minutiae of the day would be discussed and recorded in triplicate for the benefit of those later needing to review the proceedings.",
        "Mondays were already too difficult to even consider including spontaneous weather, and as Tuesdays followed Mondays, they were also a settled matter. Wednesdays were, and always had been, reserved for sport tournaments. Only once had it rained on a Wednesday, and that regrettable oversight led to a dozen ruined paint jobs, a hand full of arrests, and a panic stricken individual convinced they were drowning in the comfort of their porch rocking chair. Three emergency sessions later, and through countless mountains of paperwork, it seemed the matter had all but been resolved via democratic debate. So for the interim, Wednesday was strictly off limits for inclement weather.",
        "Thursday and Friday were no better, as those leaving work were finally free to take the weekend as they wished, so rain was not a welcome sight there either. Saturdays, as one could guess, were busy catching up on all things left to the last minute. Sadly, that left Sunday, and only for a single slot of time. Only then could everyone nuzzle up during the lull of the day, and stare out their windows as the perfectly tuned and precisely executed downpour pounded the city for the pre-agreed up time of exactly 1 hour 35 minutes. Not one minute more, or one drop less.",
        "And above all this, orchestrating this weather, was a man sitting in an orthopaedically approved chair, in an air-conditioned room high above the city. Basking in the gentle loving glow of fluorescent lighting, in the midst of all this malaise, at the heart of all this weather, was James Icarus Banks.",
        "Mr. Banks watched the weather every day from 9:06 to 4:53. He was a weatherman, and he oversaw the most complex meteorological system ever devised, on board one of the most technologically advanced machines ever conceived. It was known as the Leviathan. His ship was accompanied by two others, The Memento, and the Ark. They were its sisters, each equally impressive in their size and achievement. A single ship stretched the length of New York’s Manhattan, as if a great knife had descended down and slipped into the earth, cutting away a raw slice of flesh.",
        "And with that wound left behind, that raw flesh bled life, seeping out to pool into thousands of schools, parks, homes, skyscrapers and streets. In those small corners of the ship, people lived, laughed, started families, died, were born, played music, competed, lost, flipped burgers, mopped floors, wrote stories, and lived their lives with only the thin hull of the ship protecting them from the oblivion of nothingness that was the expanse of space.",
        "And Mr. Banks, who oversaw this triumphant testament of man’s ability to carve in the vast desert of space a single bastion of life, knew only two things would never change. The first, as he knew all too well, was the weather. The second was this; He was unbelievably, undeniably, unequivocally bored out of his mind.",
        "Something had to change."
