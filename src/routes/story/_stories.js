      "text": ["It was a beautiful summer’s day, 70 degrees, with scattered clouds and the occasional cool breeze. It had been that way every moment, of every day, for the last 5 years, save for the pre-scheduled rain burst at exactly 12:01 to 1:35. People had, and continued to be, very particular about the weather. Some wanted downpours, others a gentle trickle. It couldn’t occur in the early hours, or too late in the evening. Every drop was meticulously orchestrated and accounted for.", "It had never rained in the morning, or on a sunday. Evenings were off-limits, of course, and those times that had been chosen were only agreed upon after an arduous and lengthy process of debate. Each neighborhood meet on a bi-weekly basis to discuss the matter, always requiring a quorum, where all the minutiae of the day would be discussed and recorded in triplicate for the benefit of those later needing to review the proceedings.", "Mondays were already too difficult to even consider including spontaneous weather, and as Tuesdays followed mondays, they were also a settled matter. Wednesdays were, and always had been, reserved for sport tournaments. Only once had it rained on a wednesday, and that regrettable oversight led to a dozen ruined paint jobs, a hand full of arrests, and a panic stricken individual convinced they were drowning in the comfort of their porch rocking chair. Three emergency sessions later, and thru countless mountains of paperwork, it seemed the matter had all but been resolved through democratic debate. So for the interim Wednesday was strictly off limits for weather.", "Thursday and Friday were no better, as those leaving work were finally free to take the weekend as they wished, so rain was not a welcome sight there either. Saturdays, as one could guess, were busy catching up on all things left to the last minute. Sadly, that left sunday, and only for a single slot of time. Only then could everyone nuzzle up during the lull of the day, and stare out their windows as the perfectly tuned and precisely executed downpour pounded the city for the pre-agreed up time of exactly 1 hour 36 minutes. Not one minute more, or one drop less.", "And above all this, orchestrating this weather, was a man sitting in an orthopaedically approved chair, in an air-conditioned room high above the city. Basking in the gentle loving glow of fluorescent lighting, in the midst of all this malaise, at the heart of all this weather, was James Icarus Banks.", "Mr Banks watched the weather every day from nine to five. He was a weatherman, and he oversaw the most complex meteorological system ever devised, on board one of the most technologically advanced machines ever conceived. It was known as the Leviathan. His ship was accompanied by two others, The Memento, and the Ark. They were its sisters, each equally impressive in their size and achievement. A single ship stretched the length of New York’s Manhattan, as if a great knife had descended down and slipped into the earth, cutting away a raw slice of flesh.", "And with that wound left behind, that raw flesh bled life, seeping out to pool into thousands of schools, parks, homes, skyscrapers and streets. In those small corners of the ship, people lived, laughed, started families, died, were born, played music, competed, lost, flipped burgers, mopped floors, wrote stories, and lived their lives with only the thin hull of the ship protecting them from the oblivion of nothingness that was the expanse of space.", "And Mr Banks, who oversaw this triumphant testament of man’s ability to carve in the vast desert of space a single bastion of life, knew only two things would never change. The first, as he knew all too well, was the weather. The second was this; He was unbelievably, undeniably, bored out of his mind.", "Something had to change"],

      "text": ["Sitting in a small office, high above the city, Banks realized that he, and he alone, had complete control of the weather, if only until someone realized the now layed-off Ms. Florentine had suddenly logged in on a Sunday afternoon. Of course, that was unlikely. The investors of the Leviathan had spared no expense in its creation, save for Technical and Administrative personnel, many of whom refused to work on Sundays. They were a bit understaffed.", "On the screen in front of him, the time was 1:35. In one minute, the weekly pre-scheduled neighborhood association's sunday downpour would end. He had to make the most of this time, savor every moment, or better yet, stop it from ending. Furiously typing, fingers flying on the keyboard, he entered out a single command, then hit enter. Waiting, holding his breath, the clock stuck at 1:35, unchanging. Every synchronized clock on the ship was stuck at 1:35pm, on a Sunday afternoon. Outside, the rain continued pouring.", "Spinning in his chair to stare at the monitors next to him, Banks watched as the gentle downpour outside continued past it's usually pre-determined stop time of 1:36. Basking in the gentle glow the screens, each monitor was a window into the different lives of the neighborhoods on the ship. Those neighborhoods, from the look of it, were quickly descending into chaos.", "Many of the streets were starting to show signs of flooding. The storm drains, normally well equipped to funnel water to redistribution centers, were no longer open. The storm systems were independently scheduled, using their own internal clocks for redundancy. It's system, and the meteorological systems, were now completely out of sync.", "On another screen, small shapes, which Banks could only assume to be children, were jumping in the small lakes left by the downpour. Around them, a sea of cars were beginning to form, their owners long having abandoned them due to a lack of visibility. It had been years since any cars were built with windshield wipers, as it neither rain, nor gusted. At Least, not without a schedule.", "A smile slowly began to creep up the sides of Banks mouth, as he eyes darted from one monitor to another.A man was shaking his fist at a cloud, using a waste bin as a makeshift umbrella. A woman was covering her dogs mouth, fearing it might drown, as the creature stared into the downpour, utterly and completely dumbfounded.", "And while the mayhem roared down on the city, banks began to lean back in his chair, and grinned a large toothy grin. People panicking, children playing, no one would be sure when, or whether, the weather would end; And that was exactly as Banks intended it."]

      "text": ["Going to HR was not Banks favorite past time. It was always very involved, very arduous, and worst of all, extremely accommodating. Of course, that wasn't entirely HR's fault. HR had long ago been completely automated, all it's human inhabitants fired, layed off, or generally given reduced benefits to 'gradually downsize', and since replaced with self-help kiosks. Almost immediately, office satisfaction had gone up, as reported by the quarterly employee survey. It had been a smashing success, by all possible means of measurement, also supplied by the new HR department.", "Still, Banks wished there were a more convenient way to deal with internal office politics and general job satisfaction, but this was the way things were, and there wasn't much Banks could do about it. Getting up, banks headed to HR, by turning 45 degrees in his chair, reaching his hand out, and opening the HR-Self-Help Kiosk tucked away in the corner of his Office. Stepping inside, he closed the privacy door behind him, shielding himself from any discerning ears that might be listening in his private office", "The kiosk was cozy, warm, and generally comfortable enough, with a large screen smack in the middle of the enclosure. Peering at it, Banks began to fill the prerequisite questions that every HR visited mandated."],

Simple, intuitive, and oftentimes built by the lowest bidder, they were the culmination of countless many hours of efforts in standardization, improved accessibility, and accommodating user experiences.", "Holding down the shift key (the capslock having long-since been removed for more accomodating written conversations), banks typed out the password, and as easy as that, he was now operating as Ms. Florentine.

Banks prefereded appending the hour at the back, and Ms. Florentine appending it to the front.", "In all honesty, the implementation of Daylight savings was never a popular democratic initiative. Shifting an hour back would have caused massive interruption to meteorological instruments, which were only ever designed for a unidirectional time flow in intra-ship time schedule. On the other hand, shifting the hour to the front was a bureaucratic nightmare. Local mayers and leaders were concerned shifting forward would inevitably cause a mass mishap in late appointments, unbused school children in the wee hours of the morning, and congressional sessions that would interweave into pre-planned holidays. It was considered far too risky, and far too difficult. And so it was left lingering.", "As for Ms. Florentine, she was a victim of recent downsizing across multiple departments, having long since left the Meteorological and Logistics Offices. Her room though had never been cleaned out, as both HR and maintenance had been downsized as well. The matter had long since fallen to the wayside.
