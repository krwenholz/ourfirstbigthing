  <h2>FAQ</h2>

    <summary>What kind of content is this?</summary>
    Choice oriented tales. We're working with creators interested in producing
    science fiction, fantasy, murder mystery, and even geographic noir. As long
    as their tale allows the reader to enjoy the agency of creation, we're
    interested in publishing.

    Their names are on the stories! But seriously, we're sourcing creators
    wherever we can find them. The only real criteria being that they write
    interesting tales we think people would like. If you or someone you know can
    do that then please reach out to us at
