<h2>Turning Point Tales: Privacy Policy</h2>

<p>We take your privacy seriously, we're proud to barely know anything about you! Read below for an explanation of our policies and terms for keeping your adventures secret and safe.</p>

<p>Effective date: April 25, 2018</p>

<p>Thanks for entrusting How Hard Would It Be LLC with your stories, time, and personal information. We don't keep much of the latter (more below), but we do take our responsibility seriously. This document lets you know how we're handling it.</p>


<h3>The short version</h3>

<p>We only collect the information you choose to give us, and we process it with your consent, or on another legal basis; we only require the minimum amount of personal information that is necessary to fulfill the purpose of your interaction with us; we don't sell it to third parties; and we only use it as this Privacy Statement describes. No matter where you are, where you live, or what your citizenship is, we provide the same standard of privacy protection to all our users around the world, regardless of their country of origin or location.</p>

<p>Of course, the short version doesn't tell you everything, so please read on for more details!</p>

<h3>What information Turning Point Tales collects and why</h3>

<h4>Information from website browsers</h4>

<p>If you're just browsing the website, we collect the same basic information that most websites collect. We use common internet technologies, such as cookies and web server logs. This is stuff we collect from everybody, whether they have an account or not. Only account holders are subject to cookies, and those just tell us you have an account.</p>

<p>The information we collect about all visitors to our website includes the visitor’s browser type, language preference, referring site, additional websites requested, and the date and time of each visitor request. We also collect potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses.</p>

<h5>Why we collect this information</h5>

<p>We collect this information to better understand how our website visitors use Turning Point Tales, and to monitor and protect the security of the website.</p>

<h4>Information from users with accounts</h4>

<p>If you create an account, we require some basic information at the time of account creation. You will create your own user name and password, and we will ask you for a valid email address. You also have the option to give us more information if you want to, and this may include "User Personal Information.".</p>

<p>"User Personal Information" is any information about one of our users which could, alone or together with other information, personally identify him or her. Information such as a user name and password, an email address, a real name, and a photograph are examples of “User Personal Information.” User Personal Information includes Personal Data as defined in the General Data Protection Regulation.</p>

<p>User Personal Information does not include aggregated, non-personally identifying information. We may use aggregated, non-personally identifying information to operate, improve, and optimize our website and service.</p>

<p>We may ask you for credit card information to purchase products on this site. If we do so, we do not store that information. Instead we use a trused third party service, for example Stripe, to securely store and handle this information. It's not that we can't be trusted, we just trust those experts more. In these cases, we are still responsible for removing your information with them if you remove your account with us and will do so promptly if you ever delete your Turning Point Tales account.</p>

<h5>Why we collect this information</h5>

<ul>
  <li>We need your User Personal Information to create your account, and to provide the services you request, including to provide the Turning Point Tales service, the Marketplace service, or to respond to support requests.</li>
  <li>We use your User Personal Information, specifically your user name, to identify you on Turning Point Tales.</li>
  <li>We use it to fill out your profile and share that profile with other users if you ask us to.</li>
  <li>We will use your email address to communicate with you, if you've said that's okay, and only for the reasons you’ve said that’s okay. Please see our section on email communication for more information.</li>
  <li>We use User Personal Information and other data to make recommendations for you, such as to suggest stories you may want to read or contribute to. For example, when you fill out an interest survey at account creation, we learn from it — as well as from your public behavior on Turning Point Tales, such as the stories you star — to determine your adventuring interests, and we recommend similar stories. These recommendations are automated decisions, but they have no legal impact on your rights.</li>
  <li>We use your User Personal Information for internal purposes, such as to maintain logs for security reasons, for training purposes, and for legal documentation.</li>
  <li>We limit our use of your User Personal Information to the purposes listed in this Privacy Statement. If we need to use your User Personal Information for other purposes, we will ask your permission first.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Our legal basis for processing information</h4>

<p>Under certain international laws (including GDPR), How Hard Would It Be LLC is required to notify you about the legal basis on which we process User Personal Information. How Hard Would It Be LLC processes User Personal Information on the following legal bases:</p>

<ul>
  <li>When you create a Turning Point Tales account, you provide your user name and an email address. We require those data elements for you to enter into the Terms of Service agreement with us, and we process those elements on the basis of performing that contract. We also process your user name and email address on other bases. Turning Point Tales does not collect or process a credit card number, but our third-party payment processor does.</li>
  <li>When you fill out the information in your user profile, you have the option to provide User Personal Information such as your full name, an avatar which may include a photograph, your biography, your location, your company, and a URL to a third party website. You have the option of setting a publicly visible email address here. We process this information on the basis of consent. All of this information is entirely optional, and you have the ability to access, modify, and delete it at any time (while you are not able to delete your email address entirely, you can make it private).</li>
  <li>Generally, the remainder of the processing of personal information we perform is necessary for the purposes of our legitimate interests. For example, for security purposes, we must keep logs of IP addresses that access Turning Point Tales, and in order to respond to legal process, we are required to keep records of users who have sent and received DMCA takedown notices.</li>
  <li>If you would like to request erasure of data we process on the basis of consent or object to our processing of personal information, please contact us at <a href="mailto:support@turningpointtales.com">support@turningpointtales.com</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h3>What information Turning Point Tales does not collect</h3>

<p>We do not intentionally collect sensitive personal information, such as social security numbers, genetic data, health information, or religious information. Although Turning Point Tales does not request or intentionally collect any sensitive personal information, we realize that you might store this kind of information in your account, such as in a story or in your profile. If you store any sensitive personal information on our servers, you are responsible for complying with any regulatory controls regarding that data.</p>

<p>If you're a child under the age of 13, you may not have an account on Turning Point Tales. Turning Point Tales does not knowingly collect information from or direct any of our content specifically to children under 13. If we learn or have reason to suspect that you are a user who is under the age of 13, we will unfortunately have to close your account. We don't want to discourage you from learning to adventure, but those are the rules. Please see our <a href="/tos.html">Terms of Service</a> for information about account termination. Other countries may have different minimum age limits, and if you are below the minimum age for providing consent for data collection in your country, you may not use Turning Point Tales without obtaining your parents' or legal guardians' consent.</p>

<p>We do not intentionally collect User Personal Information that is stored in your stories or other free-form content inputs. Information in your stories belongs to you, and you are responsible for it, as well as for making sure that your content complies with our <a href="/tos.html">Terms of Service</a>. Any personal information within a user's story is the responsibility of the story owner.</p>

<h3>How we share the information we collect</h3>

<p>We may share User Personal Information with your permission, so we can perform services you have requested or communicate on your behalf. For example, if you purchase an integration or other product to read tales on another platform, we will share your account name to allow the integrator to provide you services. Additionally, you may indicate, through your actions on Turning Point Tales, that you are willing to share your User Personal Information. For example, if you join an organization, the owner of the organization will have the ability to view your activity in the organization's access log. We will respect your choices.</p>

<p>We do not share, sell, rent, or trade User Personal Information with third parties for their commercial purposes, except where you have specifically told us to (such as by allowing access to stories on other platforms).</p>

<p>We do not host advertising on Turning Point Tales. We may occasionally embed content from third party sites, such as YouTube, and that content may include ads. While we try to minimize the amount of ads our embedded content contains, we can't always control what third parties show. Any advertisements on individual stories are not sponsored by, or tracked by, Turning Point Tales.</p>

<p>We do not disclose User Personal Information outside Turning Point Tales, except in the situations listed in this section or in the section below on Compelled Disclosure.</p>

<p>We do share User Personal Information with a limited number of third party vendors who process it on our behalf to provide or improve our service, and who have agreed to privacy restrictions similar to our own Privacy Statement by signing data protection agreements. Our vendors perform services such as payment processing, customer support ticketing, network data transmission, and other similar services. When we transfer your data to our vendors, we remain responsible for it. While Turning Point Tales processes all User Personal Information in the United States, our third party vendors may process data outside of the United States or the European Union. If you would like to know who our third party vendors are, please contact us at <a href="mailto:support@turningpointtales.com">support@turningpointtales.com</a>.</p>

<p>We may share User Personal Information if we are involved in a merger, sale, or acquisition. If any such change of ownership happens, we will ensure that it is under terms that preserve the confidentiality of User Personal Information, and we will notify you on our website or by email before any transfer of your User Personal Information. The organization receiving any User Personal Information will have to honor any promises we have made in our Privacy Statement or in our Terms of Service.</p>

<h3>How you can access and control the information we collect</h3>

<h4>Data retention and deletion of data</h4>

<p>Generally, Turning Point Tales will retain User Personal Information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services.</p>

<p>We may retain certain User Personal Information indefinitely, unless you delete it or request its deletion. For example, we don’t automatically delete inactive user accounts, so unless you choose to delete your account, we will retain your account information indefinitely.</p>

<p>After an account has been deleted, certain data, such as contributions to others' stories and comments in stories, will remain. However, we will delete or deidentify your personal information, including your user name and email address, from the author field a ghost user.</p>

<h3>Our use of cookies and tracking</h3>

<h4>Cookies</h4>

<p>Turning Point Tales uses cookies to make interactions with our service easy and meaningful. We use cookies (and similar technologies, like HTML5 localStorage) to keep you logged in, remember your preferences, and provide information for future development of Turning Point Tales. We also use cookies to identify a device, for security reasons. By using our website, you agree that we can place these types of cookies on your computer or device.

<p>We only use session cookies to identify you as a user and we do not share these cookies with other sites.</p>

<h4>Tracking and analytics</h4>

<p>We use a number of third party analytics and service providers to help us evaluate our users' use of Turning Point Tales; compile statistical reports on activity; and improve our content and website performance. We only use these third party analytics providers on certain areas of our website, and all of them have policies similar to ours that limit the type of personal information they can collect and the purpose for which they can process the information.</p>

<p>We do not currently respond to your browser's Do Not Track signal, and we do not permit third parties other than our analytics and service providers to track Turning Point Tales users' activity over time on Turning Point Tales. We do not track your online browsing activity on other online services over time and do not allow our third party tools to do so.</p>

<h3>Turning Point Tales's global privacy practices</h3>

<p>We store and process the information that we collect in the United States in accordance with this Privacy Statement (our subprocessors may store and process data outside the United States). However, we understand that we have users from different countries and regions with different privacy expectations, and we try to meet those needs even when the United States does not have the same privacy framework as other countries'.</p>

<p>We provide the same standard of privacy protection — as described in this Privacy Statement — to all our users around the world, regardless of their country of origin or location, and we are proud of the levels of notice, choice, accountability, security, data integrity, access, and recourse we provide.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Turning Point Tales provides clear methods of unambiguous, informed consent at the time of data collection, when we do collect your personal data using consent as a basis.</li>

  <li>We offer you simple methods of accessing, correcting, or deleting the User Personal Information we have collected.</li>
  <li>We provide our users notice, choice, accountability, security, and access, and we limit the purpose for processing. We also provide our users a method of recourse and enforcement. These are the Privacy Shield Principles, but they are also just good practices.</li>
</ul>

<h3>How we respond to compelled disclosure</h3>

<p>Turning Point Tales may disclose personally-identifying information or other information we collect about you to law enforcement in response to a valid subpoena, court order, warrant, or similar government order, or when we believe in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect our property or rights, or those of third parties or the public at large.</p>

<p>In complying with court orders and similar legal processes, Turning Point Tales strives for transparency. When permitted, we will make a reasonable effort to notify users of any disclosure of their information, unless we are prohibited by law or court order from doing so, or in rare, exigent circumstances.</p>

<h3>How we, and others, communicate with you</h3>

<p>We will use your email address to communicate with you, if you've said that's okay, and only for the reasons you’ve said that’s okay. For example, if you contact our Support team with a request, we will respond to you via email.</p>

<p>Depending on your email settings, Turning Point Tales may occasionally send notification emails about changes in a story you’re watching, new features, requests for feedback, important policy changes, or to offer customer support.

Please note that you can not opt out of receiving important communications from us, such as mails from our Support team or system emails.</p>

<p>Our emails might contain a pixel tag, which is a small, clear image that can tell us whether or not you have opened an email and what your IP address is. We use this pixel tag to make our email more effective for you and to make sure we’re not sending you unwanted email.</p>
