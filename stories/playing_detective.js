        "The faint sound of police alarms stirs you from your slumber. \n",
        "The smell of a cigarette‚Äôs smoke, the tick-tock of a mounted clock, and complete darkness are the first things that welcome your consciousness. As you relax on what feels like a wooden chair, your blank mind tries to start up - the little man in your head starts cranking you awake like an early Ford automobile. Despite the mental image, your mind sputters and barely kickstarts. A small exhalation and your own alcohol-tinted breath is redirected to your face. \n",
        "You are half-asleep, half-cognizant. The sound of cars honking their horns and people yelling is faint but un-muffled. The sound feels carried along with the breeze of a small draft tickling the hairs at the base of your skull. An open window, one that needed to be closed...eventually \n",
        "You open your eyes, but the lids only open half-way. You expect a blurry image of a room, fuzzy furniture and a person that looks like they were bleeding watercolors. Instead, you only see darkness. The brim of the hat tilted on your head that you suddenly feel masks all sight except where cloth touches the top of your head - and even then you can‚Äôt see it. Feels no better than wearing a burlap sack. \n",
        "Some people can wake up easily with no alarm, just the pure power of the mind and a healthy sleep cycle. They could just jump out of bed and run a marathon, or be half a pack in before breakfast. Your neutral state is half-dead, and even then, you are hampered by the hooch weighing you down. What little lucidity you have has not told you whether today will be a fine day or a day where the headache will be as overbearing. Is it even the day? Unbelievable as it may be, but when one‚Äôs current visual landscape is the shady underbelly of a hat the darkness is less fantastic than the night sky. \n",
        "Willpower is something you have, or at least you think you do. You‚Äôre unsure how much hold the alcohol still has on your system. The call of sleep beckons, accented by the drafty urban chorus. Such a soothing dissonance does wonders on a body seeped in hooch. Still, something was nagging at the back of your mind, a lingering idea that is threatening to wake you, possess you and make it the sole thought in your mind. Both sleep and cognizance await a call, the difference between the hours of rest and facing a brand new day is just standing up. \n"

        "With a grumble, you toss the hat off of your head and open your eyes. You yawn, stretch your arms and look at your surroundings - and then promptly wish you went back to sleep. \n",
        "'Drab office' is an understatement. Sure, the usual suspects are around: wooden clock, wooden desk, hat-stand, a mess of chairs et cetera. To you everything felt shoved in what can only be an apartment. One that has seen better days too. An office that isn‚Äôt even a proper office, like a living room barbershop. \n",
        "Everything comes back to you in an instant but it's the mental equivalent of drawing a two-pair in poker. There is not much to unpack other than two burning questions that overtake every worry. \n",
        "Where are you? Who are you? \n",
        "You‚Äôre dressed in slightly unkempt, baggy clothes consisting of suit pants and button-up shirt. No tie but you are sporting a long, shabby brown coat and a hat with a wide brim, also brown. You put your hands in your pockets. A wallet and a gun. First, you open up the wallet. Hopefully, it has an idea of who you are. \n",
        "James L. Sinclair, age forty and under contract for the Peterson Detective Agency. A private dick. That is all the information you could glean from the driver‚Äôs license and business cards besides an extremely messy signature in handwriting so ineligible that signing ‚ÄúX‚Äù could be mistaken for Khmer script. The rest of the contents of the wallet show no more clues, that is unless you happen to be the spitting image of Benjamin Franklin. For such a shabby apartment you sure are packing more than just a headache in a variety of ways. \n",
        "Speaking of packing heat, you exchange the wallet with the gun. A two-inch barrel and what looks to be double action. A snub-nosed revolver ‚Äî not just any type of revolver, a Colt. The model commonly nicknamed the ‚ÄòDetective Special‚Äô. \n",
        "You pocket the revolver with full knowledge of who you were. James L. Sinclair, a private detective seemingly fresh off a case. You decided to have a drink in celebration of a job well done, bourbon, guessing from the bottle on the desk. You drank too much and blacked out, hitting your head and giving yourself amnesia. That last bit might be a stretch, how hard of a blunt impact would be needed to cause that much damage? You have an explanation for the money and why your breath smells of hooch, but the amnesia is the ultimate mystery. You don't buy it. \n",
        "Okay, maybe your mental deduction isn‚Äôt the best. Blame your confusion and the alcohol. The possibility you stole the cash was another option. \n",
        "James L. Sinclair, private detective and possible purse snatcher. \n",
        "A third option pops to life and it isn‚Äôt a desirable one. No, not a desirable one at all. You start pacing the room and almost miss the body laying past the chairs, hidden by the cushiony backs. \n",
        "Mid-forties, male. The corpse sports short, greyish-black hair affected heavily by male-pattern baldness. Dressed only in his undergarments, he lay in the same pose that a mummy still in the sarcophagus would adopt. There is no pool of blood, no stab wound nor bullet hole pockmarking his body, which looked bruise less as well. You rule strangulation out of the possibilities for cause of death; no ligature damage and no bruising. Heart attack? Poison? In any case, the chance of it being murder is high. To recap, there‚Äôs a dead body and you woke up wearing the dead body‚Äôs clothes with no clue who you are. \n",
        "Looks like you are not who you initially thought you were. The man on the floor is or rather was James L. Sinclair, private detective. There is still a chance that you were just in the most immaculate shape a middle-aged man has ever seen and the corpse is just some pervert you killed. Not likely. You don't feel middle-aged at all. \n",
        "In any case, leaving a body out in the open would be immensely troublesome if someone entered the room, especially since you have the notion that it is his clothes you‚Äôre wearing. Something needs to be done. \n"

Voices yelling, the sound of police sirens down below, and the sound of shoes tramping on wood getting louder and louder. You quickly jump to your feet, the hat falls off your face and in your hands. You are surrounded by what seems to be the entire local police station, guns drawn, batons unsheathed and you, utterly confused. Before you could raise your hands in the air, before you could even from the beginning of a sentence two arms snake their way under yours and start dragging you across the room. \n",

A body, fashioned solely in his skivvies laying dead on his back. Expressionless, motionless, dead. Or was it? As you are dragged across the threshold from room to hallway, you could swear you just saw the body‚Äôs limp head turn to you, smile and wink. Before you could even try and reconfirm what just happened, your body is marched out and down what seemed like an endless staircase of metal railing and wooden doors. \n",
        "There are no reporters, nor any pedestrians caught in the middle of the arrest. The building might have just been you in your lonesome with a corpse splayed in the middle of the room. It was almost unsettling that nobody poked their head out of a door to see what all the hubbub was about. \n",
        "All in the meanwhile, you are like a blown light bulb. So many questions rattling in your head yet no light, no spark of wakefulness as you are ushered out into the waiting police car. \n",
        "The door closes, and before you stare straight ahead, something catches your eye from building you just exited. Your eyes zoom up to the window of the room you were sleeping in. A figure, the silhouette of a man, waving an open hand in goodbye. \n",
        "The police car starts moving down the street. The policemen, originally rowdy are now subdued as the car‚Äôs police radio starts blaring. White noise fills the small car and quickly your thoughts are replaced with the monotonous static. Your mind goes blank, your eyes shut. The movements of the car sooth you, lull you into a lethargic mood. As you await your sentencing, you watch the phosphenes dancing in the darkness. You shift your hat over your face and everything goes dark. \n"

Sinclair is lifted onto your shoulders. The room does not have many hiding places big enough to fit a fully-grown body, that is for sure. It‚Äôs time to be creative. \n",
        "The first idea: the armoire. It sure looks big enough to hold a corpse. Though what if he fell out? That would be a massive problem. With your free arm, you check the handles of the armoire. Loose. The wood is old, the handles one screw turn from falling off. Not an ideal place to hide a corpse, he would fall out if jostled. Next idea. \n",

He‚Äôs just not going to look nice at the end. \n",

Desecration of a corpse, probably multiple counts on top of a possible homicide if not accessory and tampering with a crime scene for moving the body.

You bet a fiver against nobody that every speakeasy joint in the city knew his name. At least he didn't have a full gut. It‚Äôs just a shame that there is no notebook with their secret passwords jotted down. Here you are, fresh of mind thanks to the amnesia, dealing with a dead body at night.

        "Your ears are ringing, but you don‚Äôt let it concern you. All you care about is the hole in the back of the police sergeant‚Äôs head. He falls slowly. Everything seems to slow down with his descent. The interval between your breaths feel like ages, so does the pause between the tick-tock of the clock. The five other policemen slowly turn around in stunned silence. You pull the trigger again, momentarily forgetting that the gun only had a single bullet in the chamber. It clicks, the cylinder rotates to another empty slot. \n",

You don‚Äôt blink, you don‚Äôt raise your arms, you don‚Äôt even blink. You don‚Äôt have time to move before five service revolvers are pointed at you.

Your last thoughts solely comprise of thinking how shitty a way it was to go, face-up in a seedy apartment, no memory of who you are. You can‚Äôt feel the presence of the policemen anywhere, as if they were not even real in the first place.

The top of the desk looked alive, there are notebooks and papers, so they most likely haven't been fired or done for the dat.

From there, the policemen start leading out of the empty lobby and onto the sidewalk. It isn‚Äôt a far walk to the destination, just around the corner. Literally. At the side of the building lies an alleyway sandwiched between the complex you just came out of and the neighboring building, a tower of offices. \n",

Too many police cars hanging around the scene, parked in any place that they could fit. Once those choice spots were taken, it looks like they almost tried stacking them on-top of each other to save space. They must be training the new recruits or something; a crime scene field trip. That might explain the colonel, and the sergeant waiting just ahead. \n",

He sure is not familiar to you but that is a feeling that stretches to everyone and yourself. Now that you think about it, you don't even know what you properly look like. \n",

The policemen did not seem to mind, but even if they did not the sergeant surely would care. Jail might be a good place to sober up, but it is dead boring to be in and the wrong location to figure out your identity. \n",

This neighborhood acts on the same rules that people did in the last century. It‚Äôs simple, we spirit away their annoying brats, I become friends with the families and Sinclair to them. The kids are all spoiled rotten and have money, so we have them 'run away' to other countries as rebellious joyrides. Gives some of our boys plus Sinclair a vacation and leave the parents hoping for some happy news. They don‚Äôt know they are paying a ransom in the form of Sinclair's payment, but even then they don‚Äôt know if their precious wunderkind is even still alive. Some time later, their kid is found running alcohol from Mexico and winds up in jail or the like. Everything just becomes another skeleton in the family‚Äôs closet with the victim too traumatized to even point us out. We're a constant reminder and they are nothing, and we can do worse.‚Äù \n",
