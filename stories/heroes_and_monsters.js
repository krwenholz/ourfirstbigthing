The Upathu orc clan has awoken before first light to attend to the day's struggles of collecting wood for the fires, foraging, and waiting in the cold snow for the scant game. Their camp is sparse, a necessity for avoiding the winter raiders. The humans come when the snow is heavy and the food is scarce, even though the cold does little to orcs, hunger hampers all. The strongest warrior of the clan, Garo, has left his tent after only a few hours of restless sleep filled with memories of bloody snow. The full-grown orc stands tall in his furs and looks over the nomadic camp. Warriors stand watchful around the campsite, bows and arrows on them. Garo himself wields a greathammer stolen from a slain human from a winter long past. It is enough to put down the most armored of invaders.",
        "The younglings play with wolf pups and teach them how to stay quiet and fight. With food in low supply, all they can offer the pups for rewards is warm encouragement. Despite their growling stomachs the younglings remain diligent in their duties, determined to be useful. Any adult orcs not on guard duty or foraging are mending clothes or tents, tending to the sick, or sparring to keep sharp. What strikes Garo most is how thin everyone is. When he was a youngling the clan was some two-hundred strong. Now they number a mere thirty-seven. In the center of the camp is the finest tent covered in bear furs, inside is the clan‚Äôs lone elder doing what she always does, thinking and planning how to keep her people safe. Two days ago a crow flew into her tent with a message on its leg and she has not left the shelter since."

He follows the trail to a patch of trees where the snow has piled on top, keeping the dirt below clear and allowing easy access to a patch of mushrooms spreading as a feast across the ground.

They orcs kill with efficiency and brutality, but there are far more men. Fear sobers them quickly and the orcs' momentum halts as a full-blown melee erupts. Mion and N√≥g join the fray with unique effectiveness. N√≥g coats men in her golden faerie dust and sets them alight. Mion wrenches a tentpole from the earth and swipes away swathes of men with each swing. Garo drenches himself in blood as he crushes as many men with his great hammer as his arms can withstand. When all the humans are dead, nearly half of the surviving orcs lay dead with them. Garo stands surrounded by gore and hopes he did the right thing. At the very least, these men will do no harm ever again.",

The human's shield against the forest becomes a flaming prison. As pandemonium breaks out in the camp Mion charges forth with his horns and with a chilling roar flips the center wagons on their sides. The humans slash and stab at Mion, but his thick hide resists much of it and his roars of anger freezes some in their tracks. Those weaker willed soldiers Mion picks up and throws back into the woods to be killed and their weapons and armor rapidly distributed among the waiting orcs. Mion retreats after throwing his sixth soldier into the woods with a violent crash and for a moment the humans cheer as if their struggles are done. As soon as Mion reaches the darkness the orcs charge in with a war cry made of nightmares and Mion returns wielding a fallen tree.",
        "\"Spear wall! Spear wall!\" calls out the human leader, but he is too late. The monsters flood into the camp and make up for their numbers through sheer brutality. No human faces less than six orcs at once. They move from one poor soul to the next, taking them to the ground and slam their helmeted heads into the earth. They strip the men of their weapons one after another and move to the next like a flock of carrion. The horde grows stronger with each kill, even when one of their own falls to a spear or sword, the whole stands up with new steel. Many orcs die. But warriors die noble deaths and younglings become blooded warriors in the fray. When all the humans have been torn apart and the snow is red and filled with steaming bodies the monsters howl like wolves. Mion's tree has been splintered from his flurry of blows and he lays breathing heavily against a wagon, his body covered in gashes and a spear still stuck in his side. Garo kneels in the earth, his arrows exhausted and his greathammer coated in blood and bone. He looks around him as the orcs yell and realizes the cost of vengeance. Half his orcs lay dead. Garo is pulled from inside his head when his eyes wander over to N√≥g. She kneels on a human she slew all by herself, a small needle in her hand. She's crying atop her enemy.\n",

With the timer set Garo falls back into the darkness. Night becomes day for an instant as the explosion thunders out and shakes the whole forest. The flaming debris spreads far and wide. The burn goes wild and the ashes spread to distant horizons on the winter winds. It is days before the snowfall finally puts the faeries' rage to rest.",
        "Garo and his band of monsters possess few options and their souls are tired of violence and death. And so they travel West. Garo has some distant family there and it is custom for orcs to help their kin. It is a shock to the monsters when they discover a Dark Lord reshaping the land for some grander purpose.

The only light remaining comes from a handful of torches and the glow of a half-moon. Mion roars and pounds his chest as the humans grab their spears and torches and ready themselves for a charge that never comes.

A wise move as the raucous shouting of the bolder men quickly turns to bloody screams. The remaining men in the camp take up positions and scan the darkness ahead of them, ignorant of the faerie slipping in behind them on her way to the horses. With her quick and deft hands N√≥g undoes the knots binding the horses to their wagons and posts and strikes their rears with a bit of her magic. The searing heat will leave a mark, but is ultimately harmless. The horses though only feel as if their rears were suddenly aflame. Desperate to get away from the pain the horses rush out of the camp the only way they can, through the opening Mion made for them. They push aside any and all men in their path as they rush into the darkness. \n',
        "When the horses make contact with the men and the captains the chaos is just loud enough for Garo to make his move. He slams his greathammer into the back of the wagon holding the faerie dust, splintering the wood and causing the iron plates to fall off as their wooden base ceases to exist. Inside the wagon sits nothing but one crate packed tight and secured to the wagon walls. Prying open the crate Garo finds inside two kegs with golden dust. The prying action is louder than desired and Garo hears a voice call out to investigate the sound of cracking wood. With no time to spare Garo takes the kegs into his massive green arms and makes his way out of the wagon. As Garo steps into the open air he sees a mass of spearmen moving on him, the orc runs as best he can with the heavy kegs, but the humans are gaining. Garo doubts his plan for a moment when the sound of thundering hooves returns mixed with the hollering of orcs. From out of the woods comes the Upathu atop their stolen horses and the humans pursuing Garo stop in their tracks as their loss sets in.",

N√≥g flies up to Mion and sits on his shoulder, grabbing tightly to his black fur. She can‚Äôt help but look back and wave at the duped humans.",

There is little difficulty in climbing as the tree's branches are so old and large even Mion's weight does not burden them. When all have reached as high as they can go the sun finishes setting and the monsters crowd among the top of the tree like a flock of crows.",

As the dust mixers with the wind, something magical happens. The air fills with golden light as giggling surrounds the top of the tree before turning to laughter. A thousand winged and golden faerie silhouettes appear from the dust who fly and dance on the orcs as if at a great ball. One takes N√≥g's hand and holds her close as they step and spin in a gentle rhythm. Tears run down N√≥g's face as she smiles and laughs like a little girl.

I do not trust the Mirik clan, but with so little of my blood left living, I must trust those who remain. We cannot wander any longer. We need allies.

        'Garo exits the tent and quickly walks through the groups of playing children, past the tent menders, and up to the guards telling them all the same thing, "The Elder sends us westward, we leave immediately, spread the word." Accustomed to sudden leaving all remain silent as they focus on their duties and head on. Tents are rolled up. Dogs are tied to sleds. And a pair of women ready the hobbling elder for travel. Garo is showing one of the smallest younglings how to roll up the tents when the winds change and the scent reaches him, the scent of horses. In an instant the sounds of horses running through the snow fills the air and through the frozen forest comes a charge of light cavalry all dressed in white. They are a wall of spears with their shining spears reaching forward, the sun at their backs. Garo readies his greathammer in his shaking arms, "RAIDERS!"',
        "The camp guards take up positions with Garo to engage with the humans. When the wall of spears penetrates the camp Garo sidesteps and swings his hammer into a rider's chest, his light plate armor caves in and Garo feels the man's ribs give, the solid block of steel does not. One rider is dead but in that same instant thirty more flood into the camp, running through and trampling any all orcs and tents in their way.",
        'The orc bowmen fell four more riders before they come back for the second pass. "Flee! Flee now!" Garo commands the warriors, squashing his grief. "Take the younglings and go!" The second charge comes and the camp\'s numbers are once more decimated, warriors and younglings alike. The wolves were trained well, they drag down five horses with their riders and rip their throats out, saving a group of younglings from certain death. The wolves stand by their masters and bear their teeth at the humans, reading themselves for the next charge. The Upathu stand surrounded by fifteen dead and dying men and Garo feels as if the raiders could be repelled with steel and fang until a mass of raiders on foot, fifty strong, emerge from behind a snowbank. The orc\'s body goes cold and he makes a choice.',
        '"The younglings, save the younglings!‚Äù Garo and the able orcs take the seven remaining younglings and place them atop their wolves‚Äô backs. Some yell defiant and demand to fight but Garo slaps them painfully, ‚ÄúFly! Ride West and stop for nothing!" With tears in their eyes the last Upathu youths ride as fast as their beasts are able. The last dozen living orcs form a last line of defense among the ruins of their camp. They are injured and wielding anything they could find from swords to bows to even rocks. The last to join the final stand is Elder Mukal, she stands with a broken arm and leg from her trampling but in her good hand she grips a bloody axe. "Die well, my children."\n',
        "\"Die well,\" the orcs repeat as the third charge comes. The orcs roar defiant as they strike down more riders from their horses. Raiders are pinned to trees by arrows loosed at the zenith of orcish strength. The bodies pile up as skulls and jaws are ripped from bodies with axes and rocks. Eighty men attacked the Upathu this day and by the melee‚Äôs end, forty lay mangled and dead. Among them lay the last of the adult orcs. All but Garo. His chest and face are covered in slashes and his steel hammer is cracked and caked with gore. The humans encircle him with spears, jeering and hollering as they stab at him. When he rushes to break their line lasso after lasso fly out and wrap around Garo's neck and arms. It takes fours lassos and eight men to drag the orc to the ground and wrap him in shackles and chains before beating him unconscious. The next thing Garo knows he is sitting in an iron cage in the back of a wagon pushing its way through the snow, with nothing to look at but the rear wagon full of his clan's brains put in green liquid filled jars. Something inside Garo wants to scream and yell, but now he knows it is fruitless.\n"

His one solace in the journey has been watching his human captors grow tired and sick from the cold. Orcs are a hearty people, the winter air has already cost seven fingers and toes among the forty raiders while Garo is unaffected. The worse affected is the commander of the raiders whom has fallen deathly ill, his pained hacking and coughing goes deep into the night. Garo likes to imagine it is a revenge from his clan.",
        "Otherwise, the journey on the roads is mostly monotonous and full of staring off into the distance and bitter faced men. Everything changes when looking through the ragged canvas of the wagon Garo sees the raiders leave the forest road and exit to a clearing filled with stumps. As far as the eye can see, hundreds of axe-wielding men chop down tree after tree down into logs piled three men high in wagons.

Past the markets, Garo's wagon turns into a stinking loading dock behind a wooden building, its sign reading \"Stein Hunters Guild\". Garo's amazement sours into evil hopes that all those fires go wild and burn down the whole wretched city.",

They lead the orc inside through musty cobwebbed stone halls to be placed inside a lone holding cell in a secluded room. The cell is deep inside the compound where it remains open to the air but for the iron gate above it that even a minotaur would struggle to move. They leave him in the cell without a word and for the first time in weeks Garo is alone. With no one staring at him, with his enemies who knows where, and left with nothing but his thoughts the warrior can focus on little but the lonely silence around him. A great cold fills Garo and the proud survivor sits in the corner of the cell as the snow falls over him. Garo stares into the overcast sky with emerald eyes until sleep takes him."

His people will not die with him and whatever may come, he will rise above it. All the while never forgetting the unexpected kindness that got him so far. Kindness that would be repaid years on and at great cost when the monsters of the world would march on the Capital.",

        "Garo moves down the dark hallway towards the iron door. He tries the rudimentary handle and the door swings open slowly. With a quick look the room is clear of any life. And that is the tragedy the orc finds as he closes the door and the full moon's light shines in through the iced over window. Garo's jaw falls open at the horrors before him. Shelf after shelf full of brains in jars, the spines of snake-men being drained of their blue blood, and kegs filled with faeries ground into golden dust, wings and all. In the center of the room is a grand wooden table, a lifeless orc with his skull cut open and his brain missing, his eyes are wide open in a look of surprise. Even though the orc is a stranger Garo tightens his fists hard enough to make his palms bleed and his whole body shakes with anger. The words of Grandmother Mukal drift through the orc's mind as his world goes red, \"We must survive, no matter what.\""

        "Garo breathes a heavy breath that fills the room with mist. His eyes take on a clear minded focus, the warrior knows what must be done. He takes a pair of kegs of faerie dust under his arms and heads back into the hall in search of the sounds and smells of feasting. In time he locates his prey, almost a hundred men and women in fine clothes all well and truly drunk in the main hall of the guild house. All but a few guards present are lost in cups of wine. Most of the guests see the sudden appearance of the orc as some kind of prank, a wrestler who painted himself green to give them a scare. Garo quickly makes his way across the hall, spreading handfuls of faerie dust into the air and onto the wine soaked wooden floor. The guard who gorged himself on duck before Garo falls off his seat at the sight of the orc and tries to cut him down with an off-balance swing of a sword but Garo is an unstoppable force now. He drops a keg with a crash and grabs the sloppily swung blade in his hand without a thought to the harm. With cold fury Garo wrenches it from the guard's grasp and swings the sword down like a hammer, connecting the crossguard with the man's head with a great crack.",
        "The murder quickly sobers the partiers but by the time they make for the exits, it is too late. Garo drops the other dust filled keg and takes up a torch by the front doors. The orc steps outside into the snowy night and tosses the torch onto the trail of faerie dust. The golden dust sizzles and ignites as it spreads rapidly, each grain popping like a minuscule thunderclap. Once the flames reach the keg Garo has crossed the road meeting dozens of shocked and terrified screams. \"There's an orc in the Capital! There's an orc-\"",
        "The shockwave from the main hall throws Garo and all the humans outside into the snow. The main hall is leveled, its occupants vaporized. Fires spread to the neighboring buildings and those hit by flaming shrapnel. The fire rages like a thing alive, devouring even the wettest wood ravenously. In only moments the calm winter night has turned into a flaming hell and as Garo hears the bells ring and people running through the streets he knows he has wrought vengeance. In the chaos, few pay much attention to the orc wandering the streets, any that draw attention to him are quickly cut down with his stolen sword. In time he finds himself covered in blood and that he has wandered into the port where men, women, and children desperately collect sea water in buckets to save their homes. Ignoring them, Garo climbs into a small fisherman's boat and quietly rows out to sea. He watches the city burn with a small smile and feels fulfilled for a moment. But, in time his smile fades. Orcs are a hearty folk, the cold doesn't really get to them, but here alone on the sea with the distant fire getting smaller with every moment, Garo feels so cold.",

        'Garo releases his bloody grip and tears run down his face for all the loss he has known and found. He gently kisses the head of the orc on the table, "Brother or enemy, no one deserves this. We will have justice. I swear it." Garo opens the frozen window and crawls out into the snowy night and into a dark alleyway littered with discarded tarps from the loading dock. Wrapping himself tight Garo quietly makes his way toward the scent of salt water. When the bells are rung and the city watch runs around warning people of an orc, Garo carries on along the back alleyways until he finds himself standing at the port. He takes a small snow filled fishing boat and steadily begins making his way West. As Garo rows he thinks on the dark ‚ÄòLord‚Äô and wonders if they are the salvation his grandmother hoped for. Is he really a hero, or is there some other nefarious plan at work? In a world that has become so dark Garo vows to meet this being and follow him if he is true. And slay him with his bear hands if he be anything else.',
