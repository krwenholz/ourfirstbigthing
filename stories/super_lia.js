        "Dear Diary:  My life is certainly weird. Mind you, I’m not complaining, just stating a fact. Until I turned 13, I was Lia Guerera, your nice average kid. Then suddenly I turn 13 and I found out I come from a long line of super women. My mom, my grandma, and my great grandma all have super powers. Mom has super strength and speed. Grandma can read thoughts and project her thoughts. Great grandma can control energy. Turns out, I have all of their powers and then some. ",
        "You might think that being super is well, super. And frankly it is cool to be able to fly and lift buildings like they weigh nothing. But, of course, there’s a catch. When you’re stronger than everybody else you gotta be super careful. For instance, once, a whiff of my morning breath knocked out my poor dog Shep. Scared the heck out of me. I gotta be careful not to pull doors off of cars. I sneezed one and knocked down a tree. Grandma tells me that if I ever farted in public I could knock out a city block. I like to think she’s joking, but I’m not so sure.",
        "To complicate matters- my dad, who I never knew before, is back in my life. Turns out my Dad is Doctor Max Strong, a brilliant billionaire who runs a giant tech company called Science for Good, just outside of Starlight City where I live. Dad wants to help me learn to use my powers for good. I was leery but Mom convinced me that I should let dad be a part of my life. Which is cool. Though it’s a little weird that Dad’s assistant and girlfriend is a beautiful blonde android named HANA. I’m not sure HANA likes me and visa versa.",
        "The good part of having a billionaire tech genius father is, Dad hired my BFF Jason to work for him. He even built Jason a super suit, so Jason can go on missions with me. Jason is way smart, and I’m glad he’s always there for me. I know I can count on him, and he knows he can count on me. Speaking of Jason, he’s calling me now on my phone. So I guess that's it for this diary entry.",
        "I touch the accept button on my phone’s screen. Jason’s smiling face appears. “Hey, Lia!”",
        "“What’s going on, Jason?” I ask. I know Jason well. This is usually the time on Saturday morning when he likes to do his homework to get it out of the way. “Have you already finished your homework?”",
        "Jason grins. “Ah, not quite, but I have a handle on it. Something weird is going on….” he paused. “It might be nothing. It could be something. I was talking to your dad at Big Mega Science, I had some ideas how we could improve my armor.”",
        "“Okay,” I say. “That’s not unusual, you and Dad both love that science stuff.”",
        "Jason nodded. “True, but I think I heard alarms go off. Then your dad told me he had to go.”",
        "“Did he seem worried?” I ask.",
        "“Now, he just kind of looked like he was thinking.”",
        "“Jason, he always looks that way,” I insist.",
        "Jason nodded. “I know but this just felt different. Maybe we should check it out!”",
        "Before I could answer Jason, a huge ball of energy appeared in my room. I lost the connection with Jason. A tall golden skinned blonde woman appeared in my room. I leap up into the air.",
